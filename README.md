# Quantifying-Data
A data visualization project depicting data sets containing everyday “artifacts” ordered by the amount of images per each data set.

## How to Run
This project can only be run on Windows OS. To run this file, either download the 64 bit or 32 bit version project and simply click on the .exe file. This project will take a while to load because many images must be iterated through to create the data visualization.

## What This Represents
For two weeks, my classmates and I took a picture every time we encountered a certain artifact. The definition of artifact was relatively loose. For example, I took a picture of my bike whenever I saw my bike. Essentially, this project allows for all these pictures and data sets of pictures to be viewed in an easier way, while also showing users the scope and range of the data sets taken by students. 

## Understanding Visualization
When loaded, this project shows a graph with an X and Y coordinate and each image for each data set is plotted on this graph. The X coordinate runs parallel to one data set of images, so the x coordinate helps the user see the number of images contained in a single data set. The Y coordinate runs parallel an image in every data set, so this coordinate helps the user see the amount of data sets in total. When a user holds down the mouse on an image, they can see the image enlarged on the top left of the screen with some data about the information. The information shown on the grey box tells the user the name of the image, the data the image was taken, and three tags about the image which are descriptive words to describe an image which vary for each data set.
